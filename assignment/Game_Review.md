## Summary

This game is about the protagonist becoming a professor of one of three houses. There throughout the game you become to teach, learn, and grow bonds of friendship as the game goes on. 
It is a game of war and one of loss as you not only fight armies but unfortunately may battle with the ones you once educated, bringing with it more tension. In the game you meet a goddess who could control time. she lets you use this power of time to rewind. This ability lets the player go back and rethink strategies and experiment, helping them obtained victory. 
This is limited so it makes mistakes repairable but promotes the importance of thinking through your choices before acting. On the topic of gameplay, it is to be expected, it works as a turn-based game would with the player taking the first turn, the management of weaponry, items, and gold. Also, with the advantages and disadvantages with certain classes.
Like for example flying units are vulnerable to bow attack while armored units are vulnerable to hammers, maces, and a few other weapons and spells. The game has multiple paths that the player could take which increases the games replayability because of this. On the characters area they are made with unique personalities and you can see them change and grow throughout the game. This in turn makes the player care about what would happen to them make the game have more impact overall. It also helps that in this game you to play the part of a teacher, helping them grow their abilities in combat, magic, and leadership.

## Final Thoughts

Fire emblem three houses has much of its same mechanics as the games before it. From the support system to the units. Yet one of the things that it has is the power of time system and the 3 multiple paths and 1 alternate route that the player can traverse. 
From the story standpoint you are a mysterious mercenary turned professor of Garreg Mach Monastery called Byleth. He was haunted with dream like visions of a battlefield fought with a green haired woman and the king of liberation, and later a young woman seating on a throne of stone. 
You would then meet with the leaders of the three houses in the monastery.  As the story goes on every month you and the house would pick would go through challenge after challenge. You would also find out more about your situation, from what your parent did, the Player character’s past and certain attributes of Byleth’s character. As the player goes through these different paths, there are different ways that the story would go and who would win or lose at the end of it all. 
It is one of the things that I like about the game. It is the repeatability of the game that captured my attention, not to mention the companions with their unique personalities. It tends to make one care more about the fates of the people and make the player more careful on what move to make. Although the opposite is also true for some that the player might dislike. Also, with the support system the more that work together the stronger the bond, and the stronger their bond the better they work together in combat.
 There is also the time mechanic which I found novel. It allows then player to experiment on moves to grasp victory despite it being limited in its use. Although this limitation makes it more of a challenge especially in higher difficulties. Speaking of which, the combat is straightforward. There are different types of units from the flying type to armored knights. Depending on which units is taught in their skills they can excel in that class becoming stronger as a result. As a professor you teach your students everything from the way of the combat, magic, and Leadership.
In closing this game shows interesting mechanics and the different paths makes it more fun to play which is why I will give this game a 4/5 stars or 9 out of 10.
