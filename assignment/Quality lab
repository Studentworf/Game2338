the 3 common games that we have selected is- mario bros, minecraft and the first angry birds
Out of all of them I would say Minecraft is one that I would single out. Because this game has replicability. 
The mechanics of the game lets the player build things from large building to underground hovels. 
Not to mention the new area and biomes that shows every time one plays Minecraft which adds to the point of replicability.
