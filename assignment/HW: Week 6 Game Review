## Summary

This Game is about one of the arbiters of law in a war-torn World, a fatebinder. 
the story starts with an branching paths. Starting on how the player reshaped the of the tiers. 
They play starts with the map of the land where there would be choices on events that has transpired, the player could have a part in the events which would make the playthrough unique to that player.
The gameplay itself is what to be expected of an RPG, with its Tactical real-time-with-pause combat but the uniqueness of the spells does set it apart from others of its kind. 
Also, that there are some party’s abilities and mechanics that are interesting to the game.
the games unique stance on choices is clear with them showing real change to the world around you. 
From the start to the end, what occurs due to your actions from good or ill influence everything you see. 
From the allies you work with to the foes you fight, each playthrough is totally unique to the player.  


## Final Thoughts
Tyranny is a game with a unique premise, where the tyrant has won, where the player would either strengthens the power of regime or find new power from the top of the new world order. 
This premise is one that I found interesting for it is rare that a game would put you into a role of a villain. 
Usually in Rpgs or other games the player would play as the hero or works down the path, but it is a new change to be in a world already brought down to heel by a tyrant (whose true origin is unknown throughout the game).
 
Another interesting part of the game would be the choices, the first ones would be during the character creation. 
You chose the history of the player, what they have done during the conquest of the tier lands. 
Depending on the choices made by the Player the playthrough going forward would be unique as the characters in the would react to you differently due to your history. 
Also, it makes certain paths that the player takes either easier or harder depending of said choices.
As you go on, throughout the game the choices does have impact into what goes on throughout your playthrough of the game which makes subsequent playthroughs unique.
The characters and the companions you gather during the game are interesting in both personality and abilities.  
With the party abilities and the Tactical real-time-with-pause combat it could make or break confrontation depending on the situation.
In closing the game’s unique perspective on good and evil, the actual meaningful choices and the story makes it easy to give this game an 10/10 or a 5/5.
