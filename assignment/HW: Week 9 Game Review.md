## Summary
This game is about a guardian (you and a few friends), Defenders of the last city of humanity. The solar system under constant siege from emeries within and without. You rise and become one of 3 races and classes “armored Fisted Titan, mystic Powerhouse Warlock, or swift daring Hunter. Races would be human, The Changed awoken and Robotic Like Exo.

The Titans are more of aggressive and defensive in their powers, being able to create shields at will, rain destructive lighting and throwing Flaming hammers at foes. Warlock weaponize their knowledges, using the void to drain foes and creating a large concentration of energy to devastate them, create a storm of lighting and wreak havoc in the sky with their flame sword. And Lastly, the hunters could use their flaming gun, lighting staff and their void bow to surprise enemies and end the fight before it starts.


From there you would set off the fight the darkness using your abilities to explore the solar system and defending humanity wherever the threat maybe. You can play with friends in short strikes and Long raids or compete against each other in either gambit which is a PvE/PvP hybrid, or Crucible, Iron Banner and The Trials of Osiris for PVP. And all of this is with the players drive to collect exotic armor and weapons from the solar system which effects range from delivering damage or helping with support. The rarities do help with the looting shooting nature of Destiny. 

## Final Thoughts

Destiny 2 is a 5-year-old game that have gone through main changes throughout since its release. From the start you will be able to select 3 races (human Awoken and Exo) and 3 Classes (Titan, Warlock and Hunter) each have a subclass and a new “Darkness” Class which could be classified as Ice. 
About The powers, there are 4 including the Stasis power, Void, Solar, and arc. Depending on how it was used, It could make or break a moment. However, stasis itself has affected the game in many ways. 

For example, using the abilities have made PVP Much Harder for players. True to its name it freezes the player in place and defeats them when in use, making it a game changer to some and to other players a bane to their gaming day (especially if there is a full team with the Stasis ability at once). While it effects PVP in the way above it effects the enemies in PVE somewhat the same. This changes gameplay in a more strategic way, and sometimes bypassing certain defenses, if not outright breaking them.

On the story part it has evolved with every expansion, changing the threats that the guardians would face from the vex to the cabal, from the hive to the very darkness they oppose. It has gotten to be predictable to some extent but as of late it has shown to have a few surprises for players as time goes on.

In closing the gameplay and the story may have a repetitive nature but the surprises and ever-changing narrative direction makes players come back to see how it would conclude. This and some other factors  had led to me giving this game an 8/10 or an 4/5 respectively.
