## Summary
This game is about a guardian (you and a few friends), Defenders of the last city of humanity. The solar system under constant siege from emeries within and without. You rise and become one of 3 races and classes â€œarmored Fisted Titan, mystic Powerhouse Warlock, or swift daring Hunter. Races would be human, The Changed awoken and Robotic Like Exo.
The Titans are more of aggressive and defensive in their powers, being able to create shields at will, rain destructive lighting and throwing Flaming hammers at foes. Warlock weaponize their knowledges, using the void to drain foes and creating a large concentration of energy to devastate them, create a storm of lighting and wreak havoc in the sky with their flame sword. And the hunters could use their flaming gun, lighting staff and their void bow to surprise enemies and end the fight before it starts.
From there you would set off the fight the darkness using your abilities to explore the solar system and defending humanity wherever the threat maybe. You can play with friends in short strikes and Long raids or compete against each other in either gambit which is a PvE/PvP hybrid, or Crucible, Iron Banner and The Trials of Osiris for PVP. And all of this is with the players drive to collect exotic armor and weapons from the solar system which effects range from delivering damage or helping with support. The rarities do help with the looting shooting nature of Destiny.
